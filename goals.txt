README content:
    * single shortest path
    * Dijkstras Algo  -- use functions, create random graphs (directed, weighted/unweighted)
    * Connected Components
    * Common Graph
    * Euler Trails and Circuit - Fleury's Algo
    * Hamiltonian Cycles 
     -  maybe Planarity
    * Graph Coloring


Algorithms to implement:
    - prims
    - kruskals
    - floyd-warshall
    - euler-circuit 
    - ford-fulkerson: max-flow
    - Bellman-Ford
    - DAG - shortest path (put with toposort maybe)
