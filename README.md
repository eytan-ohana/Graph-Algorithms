A graph is a type of data structure that represented by a set of nodes/vertices and edges.

Graphs can be used to model many complex things like social networks where individuals are the nodes and connections between friends are the edges. 

Graphs and Graph algorithms are also widely used in navigation systems like google maps. The nodes can be intersections or popular destinations and the edges can be roads or highways connecting them. 

Additionally edges can be weighted which in the case of nav systems can be represent some sort of measure for how long the road (edge) from point a to point b is, which can take in to account physical distance, traffic conditions, and other factors.
